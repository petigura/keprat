CHISQ               Chi-squared
REJECTED            1 - chain was accepted, 0 - not
PJUMP               Which parameter was changed?
RHO                 Mean stellar density g/cc
NL1                 limb-darkening parameters. If NL3=NL4=0, then a quadratic law was adopted, otherwise a non-linear law (Claret & Bloemen 2011) was used.

DIL                 Fraction of light from additional stars in the aperture that diluted the observed transit. 0 - no dilution is present, 1 - 100% dilution 
VOF                 Radial velocity zero point (m/s).  Not used in fit
ZPT                 Photometric zero point. Detrending aims to acheive ZPT of 0.
EP1                 Time of first transit (BJD-2454900)
PE1                 Orbital period for each planet (days).
BB1                 Impact parameter 
RD1                 Ratio of planet radius and star radius
EC1                 e cos w 
ES1                 e sin w
KR1                 Radial velocity amplitude for each planet y. Doppler beaming is included (m/s)
TE1                 Secondary eclipse depth for each planet y (ppm).
EL1                 Amplitude of ellipsoidal variations for each planet y (ppm).
AL1                 Amplitude of phase-curve variations from albedo for each planet y (ppm).
